# ComWinTop

This vendor has some high quality technical data available for free on their [site](https://store.comwintop.com/) / ali express listings.
They do not seem to directly link to datasheets but - if you contact their sales team - they will link you files that appear to be hosted on the Chinese version of S3.

Example: https://wiki20210805.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/download/sensors/Smart_Agriculture/CWT-SL%20Light%20sensor%20manual.zip

While a direct link would be appreciated, their sales/support team is very easy to work with; not once have I had to explain what a datasheet is or why I need it or prove that I'm a customer.

Their datasheets are usually provided in a "bundle" of other technical data; usually a windows only tool that already knows how to interface with the sensor.
This makes it super easy to get started with their products; the tool will provide you raw bytes for packets that are known to work with the sensor.

I highly recommend this vendor for these reasons.
