# Logoele D679 CO2 Light Illumination Temperature Humidity 4in1

I was curious about which sensors are used so I opened it up.

The lux sensor is probably a BH1750FVI but the whole thing is covered in glue so I can't be sure.

The raised up board is the co2 sensor. The daughter board is soldered to the main PCB so I can't see which sensor is used for co2.

Also interesting to note, the lux and temp/humidity sensors are on the same I2C bus but with different pin outs.

PCB indicates spring 2019 design date.
