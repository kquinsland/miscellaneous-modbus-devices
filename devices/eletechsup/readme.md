This company seems to make a lot of different `$thing-to-modbus` converter modules.

I'm not sure why they have so little SEO.
Through a random [YouTube video of theirs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO9WXpsPjf-Kcc1O_N4sNIg/about), I found their website: [485io.com](http://www.485io.com/).

Most product details are `*.rar` files that have `docx`/`pdf`, code samples and more in them.
I've pulled some of the docs out of the `rar` files for quick reference but I recommend you download/extract the `rar` files for the full experience.
